// This file contains a list of feature macros. Generally you'll copy
// it to a local file ("MyFeatures.h"), tweak the defines and use it thus:
// #include <keycode.cxx>
// #include "MyFeatures.h"
// #include <Common/Base/Config/hkProductFeatures.cxx>


//////////////////
// Product inclusion
//////////////////

// The first block adds product support at a coarse level.
// Normally, these defines are automatically set by inclusion
// of keycode.inl. The detected values may be #undef-ed to
// override the product selection.
// #define HK_FEATURE_PRODUCT_AI
// #define HK_FEATURE_PRODUCT_ANIMATION
// #define HK_FEATURE_PRODUCT_CLOTH
// #define HK_FEATURE_PRODUCT_DESTRUCTION
// #define HK_FEATURE_PRODUCT_BEHAVIOR
// #define HK_FEATURE_PRODUCT_PHYSICS

//////////////////
// Library exclusion
//////////////////

// Finer grained stripping support at a library level.
// Some products are composed of several libraries, not all of which need be used.

//////////////////
// Individual feature exclusion
//////////////////

// At the finest level we can exclude individual features
// from libraries.

	// This is support for packfiles before 7.0.0 and for xml packfiles.
	// You can use the asset compiler AssetCc2 to bring old files up to date
	// as an offline process instead of linking all the versioning support.
	// You can optionally define HK_COMPAT_FILE to choose a subset of compatible
	// versions for some data savings.
//#define HK_EXCLUDE_FEATURE_SerializeDeprecatedPre700

	// This is support for versioning packfiles and tagfiles from 7.0.0 onwards.
	// This is much smaller than the pre700 data. Note that if you need to load
	// packfiles which are not the current version, you'll generally need metadata
	// for that version either in the file or compiled into the executable.
#define HK_EXCLUDE_FEATURE_RegisterVersionPatches

	// hkClass reflection is needed to use havok serialization.
	// You may also define HK_CLASSES_FILE to trim down the list of
	// linked classes. Alternatively excluding libraries and/or other
	// features will cause less classes to be registered.
	// You can turn this feature off if you're registering classes
	// elsewhere or don't need havok serialization.
// #define HK_EXCLUDE_FEATURE_RegisterReflectedClasses

	// Turn off support for the new memory reporting system.
	// This saves some static data.
// #define HK_EXCLUDE_FEATURE_MemoryTracker

	// Convex decomposition is mostly used in offline processing.
// #define HK_EXCLUDE_FEATURE_ConvexDecomposition
